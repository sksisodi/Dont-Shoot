    You were the most celebrated detective in the crime branch of New York. Almost six months ago, you were demoted from your position because you killed
    a citizen to save your partner (Detective John). However, you feel guilty despite all your efforts, you failed to protect
    your partner. You were forced to opt for a sabbatical for six months. Today
    is your sabbatical ends, and you join back the department. You are missing
    John and cannot fully recall what happened that day. You will be joining a
    new team, and a new partner will be assigned to you. Thinking about this
    makes you nervous. You notice your anti-anxiety pills on the side table next
    to you.

            I found John's mobile phone, but someone broke it. Somehow I managed to get the phone working enough to look at the GPS history. I noticed that he frequently visited the downtown subway. The triangulation from the department showed the same.
